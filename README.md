## Prerequisites

1. The prerequisites for this project were as follows:
- HTML/CSS
- Layout (flexbox or grid or framework layout)
- Javascript
- Dom manipulation
- API's (must fetch from at least one api)
- Skeleton CSS or Bootstrap
- 4 HTML pages
- Mobile responsive (aka, media queries and making them look nice)
- A design theme of some sort
- Must receive user input of some sort (input button, click, etc)
- Deploy using github pages
- Write a medium article about your process and challenges you faced.

2. Different Website Pages
- My website consisted of four different pages. The first page was simply an intro page, second page was an Article Search page, third page was a Book Review page, and the fourth page was a Movie Review page. We were demonstrating the ability to pull information from an API and display it on the page, so all of my information was pulled from the New York Times API. 

3. Different Methods/Languages Used
- My website deployed HTML/CSS/and JS. I utilized the Bootstrap framework as well for a decent amount of elements that were incorporated into my website. I also utilized a modest amount of CSS styling that was already done on Codepen. I had to manipulate it a bit after I actually got it, to make it fit my previous styling and whatnot. Javascript was used for DOM manipulation, as well as fetching my API.

4. Programs Used
- I mainly used Visual Studio Code to write this entire website, as well as the assistance of Google.

5. Contributors
- Me Myself and I!

6. Acknowledgments
- I'd like to give a shoutout to my classmates Frankie and Tate for sticking along with me as I finished this project. I ask a lot of questions and they were there every step of the way and then some. I'd also like to shoutout all my other classmates for putting up with my shenanigans, and dumb questions. BIG shoutout to Joe as well, my instructor, for teaching me EVERYTHING I know!!
